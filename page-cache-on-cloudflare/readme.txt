The fastest cache pages on Cloudflare with purge by button and automatic. You can specify URLs and cookies to exclude caching.

== Description ==
The plugin is an improved version of the "Cloudflare Page Cache" plugin. The plugin does not cache pages for logged-in users by default. You can disable caching for some URLs and for users with certain cookies (use the constants BYPASS_COOKIES_EXTRA and NON_CACHEABLE_URLS_EXTRA for the settings).
For the plugin to work, you need to have a Cloudflare account with special settings. To purge the cache by the button, you need to set Cloudflare API settings in the plugin (CF_EMAIL - From https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile, CF_API_KEY - Global API Key from https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile, CF_ACCOUNT_ID, CF_NAMESPACE_ID). In the Сloudflare account, you need to create a worker, for details go https://github.com/palessit/cloudflare-cache-page.

- Visit “Plugins” → Add New;
- Search for "Page Cache on Cloudflare"
- Download and activate the plugin
- Set Cloudflare API settings CF_EMAIL, CF_API_KEY, CF_ACCOUNT_ID, CF_NAMESPACE_ID. Use environment variables or edit the file inc/cf-page-cache.php.
